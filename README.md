Service providing support for SQLiteStudio3's DbAndroid plugin on device's side.

# Status
At the moment code is imported "as is" from relatively old Android Studio project and may (or may not) require some work to get it built. Nevertheless you can see what it takes to build it by viewing build.sh script.

The plan is to mograte the code base to more modern project layout and move from jar to arr packaging.
